<h2>OPERATIC CONFUSION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I went</span> on Saturday to hear the three operatic novelties so liberally
provided for us on the same night by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Mapleson</span>, <span class="smcap">Lago</span> and <span class="smcap">Harris</span>.
I do not mix my liquors, and I endeavour, as a rule, to keep to the same
lyrical drama throughout the evening; nor is it my fault if a good dose
of strong <span class="smcap">Beethoven</span>, sweetened with <span class="smcap">Gounod</span> and flavoured with <span class="smcap">Meyerbeer</span>
had, on the occasion in question, a somewhat confusing effect on my
brain. At Her Majesty's, <span class="smcap">Lilli Lehmann</span> was all right as <i>Leonora</i>: not
<i>Leonora</i> of <i>La Favorita</i>, but <i>Leonora</i> the favourite wife of
<i>Manrico</i>&mdash;no, not of <i>Manrico</i>, but of another personage who, like the
unfortunate <i>Trovatore</i>, has to be rescued by his loving spouse from the
tyranny of a powerful baritone; whether <span class="smcap">Verdi's</span> <i>Count di Luna</i> or
<span class="smcap">Sheridan's</span> <i>Pizarro</i>, I cannot just now call to mind. Mlle. <span class="smcap">Lehmann</span> is
not only a fine singer, but also a serious dramatic artist; and the
public was deeply impressed by her performance. She is a <span class="smcap">Lehmann</span> with
all the earnestness of a good clergyman; not that she had taken orders
as I (Box No. 70) had done.</p>

<p>From Her Majesty's Theatre, I drove in a rapid Hansom to Drury Lane. I
had told the cabman to take me to the Royal Italian Opera, and I was
about to remonstrate with him for conveying me to the wrong house, when
he promptly explained that there were now two Royal Italian Operas, one
at Covent Garden, the other at Drury Lane. New source of confusion!
"Confusion worse confounded!" as <span class="smcap">Milton</span> observes.</p>

<p>"How far have they got?" I inquired as I entered the theatre.</p>

<p>"<i>Valentine's</i> death scene," replied my friend.</p>

<p>"<i>Valentine</i> does not die, my dear fellow; <i>Valentine</i> only faints," I
answered, I was thinking of course, of the new dramatic soprano, Mlle.
<span class="smcap">Sandra</span>, in <i>Les Huguenots</i>.</p>

<p>"You are evidently not an Opera-goer," I continued, "or you would know
that no one dies in this work, except, of course, in the last Act. But
that is always left out."</p>

<p>"Wrong again!" exclaimed <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, with an amused look. "<span class="smcap">Augustus Harris</span>
restores the last Act. See his prospectus."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind that. Is <i>Ella Russell</i> singing the part of <i>Queen
Margaret</i> as well as ever?"</p>

<p>"I did not know that <i>Margaret</i> was a Queen. I always thought she was of
humble origin. The part in any case is being played by Mlle. <span class="smcap">Nordica</span>."</p>

<p>Determined to be no longer the victim of mystification, I wished <span class="smcap">Jones</span>
good-bye, and hurrying in, found the curtain down. Afraid now to ask
what was being played, I waited patiently for the next Act, and when at
last the curtain went up, I found to my astonishment that some
representation entirely new to me was taking place. Will-o'-the-Wisps on
a dark back-ground. That was all I saw. I asked myself whether I had
gone mad, or whether the Drury Lane Pantomime was being played a little
earlier than usual. Then the dark scene gave place to a scene of great
brilliancy. There was a throne at the back of the stage, and again my
thoughts reverted to the <i>Huguenots</i>, and I fancied I could recognise
<i>Queen Margaret</i>. But her features were not the features of <span class="smcap">Ella
Russell</span>. Besides, <span class="smcap">Ella Russell</span> does not dance, not at least on the
Operatic stage; and this lady did.</p>

<p>"This is <span class="smcap">Helen</span>," said a gentleman in a stall on my right to a lady by
his side. Here was at least a clue; and when at the same moment the
baritone <span class="smcap">De Reszke</span> stepped out of a group attired in the garb of
<i>Mephistopheles</i>, I said to myself that the performance had been
changed, and this was the last Act of <span class="smcap">Bo&iuml;to's</span> <i>Mefistofele</i>, with new
details, or at least details that I had not noticed when the work was
performed at Her Majesty's Theatre and at Covent Garden. Now dancing
began in earnest, and I wondered much at the never-failing ingenuity of
Mr. <span class="smcap">Augustus Harris</span>, who with a score of first-rate singers in his
Company, had nevertheless found himself compelled (probably at five
minutes' notice,) to change an Opera into a <i>ballet</i>. It reminded me of
a certain operatic Manager, who, being suddenly deprived of the services
of most of his vocalists, announced in his programme, that in
consequence of the departure of his principal singers, the music of <i>Don
Giovanni</i>, would be "replaced, for that night only, by lively and
expressive pantomime."</p>

<p>When, however, <i>Mephistopheles</i> <span class="smcap">De Reszke</span> and <i>Faust</i> <span class="smcap">De Reszke</span> both
began to sing, I saw that my supposition was untenable.</p>

<p>"What you have seen," said <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, who meanwhile had come in, and who now
occupied a seat on my left, "is not <i>Mefistofele</i> at all. It is <span class="smcap">Gounod's</span>
additional Ballet Scene for <i>Faust</i>. 'Dramatic <i>Divertissement</i>' it
ought to be called. Beautiful grouping, picturesque costumes,
magnificent scenery, delightful dance music! But you ought not to have
missed the new <i>Valentine</i>. That was a great mistake." I looked at my
watch. "Time enough for the new <i>Valentine</i> even now," I reflected; and
I went over as fast as I could to Covent Garden.</p>

<p>Here there was a new <i>Valentine</i> surely enough. A Russian lady, I was
told. Not a bit like the Russian ladies one has seen in <i>Fedora</i>, the
<i>Pink Pearl</i>, the <i>Red Lamp</i>, and other dramatic misrepresentations of
Russian life. But Mlle. <span class="smcap">Sandra</span>, or Mlle. <span class="smcap">Panaeff</span>, or whatever her name
may be, was not playing the part of a female Nihilist. She was
impersonating a well-bred, Catholic young lady of the Sixteenth Century.
<span class="smcap">Jones</span> subsequently informed me that it was not Mlle. <span class="smcap">Sandra's</span>
<i>Valentine</i> that I ought to have seen, but <span class="smcap">Victor Maurel's</span>, at the other
house.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Note at the Guildhall.</span>&mdash;Now we know what the City Marshal has to do. We
saw him in his warlike costume, bareheaded, marshalling the carriages of
the Great Personages on their departure, and capitally he did it. Not a
single name was pronounced incorrectly. Everybody came up to time, and
got away comfortably. On these occasions, the City Marshal is a sort of
Glorified Linkman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Routledge's</span> <i>Jubilee Guide to London</i>, is good, not only for such a
"high old time" as the Jubilee Week, but for the next three years or so
until the streets are re-named and a few new thoroughfares opened up.
The illustrations are excellent. There is only one objection to this
Guide as a companion, and that is it is rather too large. No Guide to be
useful should be bigger than the Handy-Volume Shakspeare size,
originally started at 85, Fleet Street. Some of the French Guides, not
the regiment, but the little books, <span class="smcap">Joanne's</span> Series, are models in this
respect.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Philips'</span> <i>Handy Volume Atlas</i> is about the right size. "The World," it
is often said, "is a small place;" but for all that, it does not go so
easily in a tail-coat pocket, where Mr. <span class="smcap">Philips'</span> <i>Atlas</i> can be
conveniently carried. It is an invaluable companion for everyday
newspaper reading. <i>Happy Thought</i> for Travellers, to whom this little
volume is recommended, "<span class="smcap">Philips</span> on his way through the World."</p>

<h2>TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING.</h2>

<center>(<i>Meteorological forecast for the Month.</i>)</center>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;Queen's Weather continues. Raspberry crop fails. Strawberries
sold by auction in Covent Garden Market, and fetch two guineas each.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Queen's Weather still continues. All the grass in Hyde Park
turns brown, and suddenly disappears. Vegetables generally sell at
famine prices. Riot of Dukes attempting to secure a bundle of late
asparagus from a fashionable West End greengrocer's, suppressed by the
police.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;Queen's Weather as settled as ever. Great drought commences.
London Water Companies cut off their supply. Five o'clock tea in
Belgravia made from boiled soda-water. Apollinaris supplied in buckets,
for washing purposes, at the rate of twenty guineas the dozen pint
bottles.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;Queen's Weather showing no signs of departure, fifteen
umbrella-manufacturers go through the Bankruptcy Court, and commit
suicide. Dust in London becomes intolerable. A Nobleman in Mayfair has
Piccadilly watered with BASS'S India Pale Ale.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;Queen's Weather established. The Thames runs dry between
Vauxhall and Westminster. The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> gives a garden-party in the bed of
the river. <i>Caf&eacute; noir</i>, made of ink, served as a refreshment.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>&mdash;Queen's Weather still continuing, seventeen ginger-beer
manufacturers who have become <i>millionnaires</i> are raised to the
Peerage. The <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> goes off his head, and, imagining that he is the
Old Pump at Aldgate, is removed, by general consent, to Colney Hatch.</p>

<hr />

<h2>FLOREAT MASCHERA!</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A Great</span> deal of curiosity has been expressed about the Gray's Inn <i>Maske
of Flowers</i>, which has puzzled a number of people. The better informed
have replied, when asked, "What <i>was</i> it?" "Oh, don't you know what a
Maske is? Why <i>Comus</i> was a Maske, don't you know?" To save time and
temper, <i>Mr. Punch</i> begs to inform all inquirers that:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. "Gray's Inn" is the Inn where the poet <span class="smcap">Gray</span> always stopped when he
came to town. It has always been associated with Poets.</p>

<p>2. This <i>Maske of Flowers</i> is not Mr. <span class="smcap">Cyril Flower</span>, M.P.'s.</p>

<p>3. It is highly improbable that the Benchers of the Four Inns of Court
will appear in Fancy Costume at four o'clock in the morning, and
serenade the occupants of the Western Face of Gray's Inn Square from the
Gardens.</p>

<p>4. The Maske is not so called from everybody in Gray's Inn appearing in
"big heads."</p>

<p>5. The <span class="smcap">Lord Chancellor</span> is not introduced as Harlequin, and does not
dance a <i>pas seul</i> with "Mr. <span class="smcap">Solicitor</span>," founded upon some of the more
intricate steps of the <i>pavan</i>, or peacock's strut.</p>

<p>6. That it is not the duty of the Master of the Revels to teach the
Masters of the Bench how to execute with spirit a Morisco.</p>

<p>Having said what the Maske will <i>not</i> be, <i>Mr. Punch</i> goes a step
further&mdash;and stops, thinking it will be better to reserve particulars

<h2>ROYALTY AT THE PALACE.</h2>

<img src="images/004.png" alt="A" width="30%" class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1"><span class="smcap">A Hard-Working</span> three weeks has H.R.H. had of it. Morning, noon, and
night, here, there, and everywhere. <i>Mr. Punch</i> was glad to see that
H.R.H. took his advice, given last week, and immediately visited the
Crystal Palace. The Fireworks were first-rate. The Prospect was
brilliant. Good omen for the C.P. If the B.P. could only get to the C.P.
in twenty minutes from Victoria, by Palace trains every twenty-five
minutes after a certain time in the afternoon, the future chances of
prosperity for the Palace would be considerably increased. By the way,
we thought we noticed some people, who had nothing to do with the
fireworks, speaking to the Lighters&mdash;the de-lighters&mdash;while in the
execution of their duty. If so, this ought to be stopped, and a notice
put up,&mdash;"You are requested not to speak to the Man at the (Catherine)
Wheel."</p>

<h2>JILLS IN OFFICE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Portion of a Stationer's Shop, used as Post Office. Two Young
Ladies (let them be distinguished as</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Cross</span> and Miss <span class="smcap">Orty</span>)
<i>discovered behind wire-screen. At opening of scene, the public is
composed exclusively of the gentler sex, and the demeanour of</i> Miss C.
and Miss O. <i>though firm, is not positively forbidding. Lady Customers,
having despatched their business move away, leaving the coast clear to
three</i> <span class="smcap">Mild Men</span>, <i>who advance to screen with a meekness designed to
propitiate. Instant transformation in both</i> Miss C. and Miss O., <i>who
gaze at them through screen with air of visitors at the Zoo who are not
fond of animals</i>.</p>

<p><i>First Mild Man (with apologetic cough).</i> Oh, good-day! [<i>Slight pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss Cross to Miss Orty (in continuation of an interrupted anecdote).</i>
Yes, I said it to him just like that&mdash;it made me so wild!</p>

<p><i>Miss Orty.</i> I shouldn't have taken any notice if it had been me.</p>

<p><i>First M. M.</i> Can you oblige me with six stamps, if you please?</p>

<p>[Miss Orty, <i>without looking at him, opens drawer, tears off six stamps,
and tosses them contemptuously underneath the screen</i>.</p>

<p><i>Second Mild Man.</i> Oh, I beg your pardon, I just called in to
inquire&mdash;&mdash; (Miss C. and Miss O. <i>regard him stonily, which has effect
of disconcerting him to some extent</i>). I&mdash;I ... there were some books I
sent off by Parcels Post from this Office the other day ... you may
remember it?&mdash;they were all in white wrappers. (Miss C. <i>and</i> Miss O.
<i>wear the resigned look of people who feel themselves in for a dull
story</i>.) Some of my friends, er&mdash;I have been given to understand, that
two of the parcels have&mdash;well, failed to arrive as yet.... Could you
kindly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss O. to Miss C. (with lifted eyebrows).</i> Know anything about the
books?</p>

<p><i>Miss C. shakes her head in scornful repudiation, whereupon Miss Orty
selects a printed form, which she jerks towards Second M. M.</i> Fill up
that, and send it in to the Postmaster-General.</p>

<p><i>Second M. M.</i> But are you quite sure they have not been mislaid <i>here</i>?
You see they are small books, and it struck me perhaps&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss O.</i> Any remarks you have to make can be put in the form.</p>

<p><i>Second M. M.</i> Quite so&mdash;but if you could only tell me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss O.</i> Can't do any more than I have done. (<i>To First M. M.</i>) I gave
you your stamps some time ago, didn't I?</p>

<p><i>First M. M.</i> Oh, yes&mdash;yes, I had the stamps, thank you. But&mdash;but (<i>with
manner of man who is compelled to enter on a painful subject</i>) there was
my change&mdash;I&mdash;I gave you half a sovereign.</p>

<p><i>Miss O. (with cold suspicion).</i> Don't remember it. You should have
spoke about it at the time&mdash;but of course, if you say you haven't had
it&mdash;I suppose&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>Deals out his change as if it was more than he had any right to
expect.</i></p>

<p><i>Second M. M.</i> One moment&mdash;am I to leave this form with you?</p>

<p><i>Miss C.</i> No. Send it to the General Post Office in the regular
way&mdash;they'll attend to it. You'll find all the directions there if you
take the trouble to look.</p>

<p><i>Second M. M.</i> Thank you <i>very</i> much. Good morning.</p>

<p>[Miss C. <i>and</i> Miss O. <i>naturally take no notice of this piece of
familiarity, and</i> Second M. M. <i>departs crushed, and gradually realises
that he is slightly annoyed</i>.</p>

<p><i>Third M. M. (presenting a telegram).</i> Will you send this off at once,
please?</p>

<p><i>Miss Orty (takes the form, and runs a disparaging eye over it, rather
as if it were an unwelcome love-letter from some detested adorer).</i>
"Post mortem's" <i>two</i> words.</p>

<p><i>Third M. M.</i> I have no objection&mdash;but it's rather important. I want it
delivered, and <i>soon</i>.</p>

<p><i>Miss O.</i> You must put the address more full than "Rumbo," then.</p>

<p><i>Third M. M.</i> But the telegraphic address is registered "Rumbo."</p>

<p><i>Miss O. (who seems to consider</i> "Rumbo" <i>somewhat too frivolous</i>).
Well, if you like to leave it so, I can <i>send</i> it&mdash;it's at your risk.
(<i>She leaves the form on the counter.</i>) Eightpence-halfpenny.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Footman, <i>with parcel</i>.</p>

<p><i>Footman.</i> How much to pay on this, Miss, please?</p>

<p>[Miss Cross <i>takes it reluctantly, slaps it down on scales with infinite
contempt, flings in weights, and then tosses a stamp and label to</i>
Footman, <i>with the brief remark, "Fourpence," spoken aggressively</i>.
Footman, <i>after paying his fourpence, and gazing from stamp to label in
a hopeless manner, opens his mouth twice, and withdraws, too intimidated
to ask for further instructions</i>.</p>

<p><i>Miss C. (still occupied with her anecdote).</i> I <i>should</i> laugh if he
came again next Sunday, just the same&mdash;shouldn't you?</p>

<p><i>Miss O.</i> I'd let him see I wasn't going to put up with it, I know!</p>

<p><i>Miss C.</i> Oh, he'll find out he won't have things all his way.
(<i>Perceives</i> First M. M. <i>evidently awaiting her leisure</i>.) Was there
anything else you were waiting for?</p>

<p><i>First M. M.</i> Er&mdash;yes. Can you let me have a Postal Order for
six-and-sixpence?</p>

<p><i>Miss C. (with decision).</i> No, I can't!</p>

<p><i>First M. M. (surprised).</i> But surely&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Miss C.</i> Give you two&mdash;one for five shillings, and one for
eighteen-pence, if <i>that</i> will do?</p>

<p><i>First M. M.</i> Of course, that's what I meant!</p>

<p><i>Miss Cross.</i> It's not what you <i>said</i>&mdash;you said <i>a</i> order. (<i>Makes out
the orders with much disdain.</i>) Three-halfpence to pay.</p>

<p><i>Second M. M. (returning).</i> Oh, I quite forgot&mdash;will you kindly cash
this order for me?</p>

<p><i>Miss O.</i> Not till you've signed it.</p>

<p><i>Second M. M.</i> Bless my heart, I quite forgot it ought to be signed!
Could you oblige me with a pen for one moment?</p>

<p><i>Miss O.</i> There's a desk over there for all that.</p>

<p><i>Second M. M.</i> I&mdash;I thought if you would let me sign it here, it would
save time&mdash;the desk is occupied at present I observe.</p>

<p><i>Miss O. (dabs a pen in the inkstand, and pushes it disdainfully through
the wire net-work.)</i> Give it back when you've finished with it.</p>

<p>[<i>She is apparently alarmed lest it should be secured as a Souvenir.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Imperious Customer, <i>and approaches screen with lordly air</i>.</p>

<p><i>Imperious Customer (blusterously).</i> Here you&mdash;one of you, let me have a
penny stamp, and a packet of thin post-cards, and two half-penny
wrappers, will you? and look sharp!</p>

<p><i>Miss C. and Miss O. (becoming instantly all smiles.)</i> Certainly, Sir.
(<i>They vie with one another in activity.</i>) Postcards in that drawer ...
I'll get the wrappers&mdash;ninepence-halfpenny, Sir, and thank you. Good
morning, Sir.</p>

<p>[<i>Exit</i> Imperious Stranger <i>snatching up his purchases and ignoring
parting smiles from behind the screen</i>. Mild Men <i>store up the lesson
for use on future occasions. Scene closes in</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span>"&mdash;the upper G.&mdash;went to hear <i>Puritani</i> on Thursday night. Of
course he called on Madame <span class="smcap">Albani</span>, and sang a few of the songs just to
give "Signor G." a hint. When the First Act was over, and the Closure
was moved by the Act-drop descending, Mr. G. went into the Lobby, and
voted with the Government of Covent Garden. Mr. G. was seen to be
several times in animated conversation with Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span>, who was decorated
with a Covent Garden Order, and was wearing a <i>Shirtcollerado
Gladstonensis</i> in his button-hole. It is, we believe, quite untrue that
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hall</span> has refused to take office&mdash;box office&mdash;in the next Liberal
Cabinet; but whether he will be made an Extra Knight or not is still
uncertain. Mr. <span class="smcap">Gye</span> is very Earnest about it, and at present we can say
no more except that the performance of <i>I Puritani</i> was first-rate, as
naturally it would be, with <span class="smcap">Albani</span>, enthusiastically received, <span class="smcap">Gayarr&eacute;</span>,
and <span class="smcap">D'andrade</span>. There were numerous <i>encores</i>, and the applause was
bestowed with a warmth which increased the temperature considerably.</p>

over Madame <span class="smcap">Patti</span> (who was singing in <i>Traviata</i> on Friday night at the

<p>A grand flare-up on Thursday last. A Jubilee <i>Soir&eacute;e</i> worthy of the
Jubilee Year and the Royal Academicians. Kings, Queens, Royal
Highnesses, Grand Dukes and Duchesses have become so common this Jubilee
month, that, when some <i>blas&eacute;</i> and well-seasoned Londoner is asked who
such and such a decorated person is, he languidly replies, "Oh! only a
King, or something of that sort."</p>

<p>There was a private Royal Night on Wednesday, when only Royalty and The
Forty R.A.'s were present,&mdash;"The Forty" did something in the oil and
colour line, as we gather from <i>The Arabian Nights</i>, revised edition, by
Lady <span class="smcap">Burton</span>,&mdash;and, of course, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, who is everywhere on every
occasion, and who, in a general way, represents H.R.H. Everybody.</p>

<p>On Thursday night, T.R.H. Everybody and Everybody Else were present, and
the scene was brilliant. Sir <span class="smcap">Frederick</span>, a Prince among Presidents and a
President among Princes, graciously welcomed the guests. He was assisted
by Sir <span class="smcap">Everett Millais</span> and Treasurer <span class="smcap">Horsley</span>, who appeared rather weary,
perhaps tired of counting the shillings, or worried by the uncertainty
of the monetary value of the <span class="smcap">Boehm</span> silver currency.</p>

<p>The Queen of the Pictures is still Professor <span class="smcap">Herkomer's</span> Lady in black
with the long gloves. She lingers in our memory, and will do so for many
a long day. May we never see her <i>in propri&acirc; person&acirc;</i>, or disappointment
might be our dole. The Lady in the picture cannot age. Even amidst all
the living breathing beauty collected within those walls on Thursday
last, the Lady on the wall, if we may so put it, "took the
cake,"&mdash;though she didn't take it all, as there was plenty left for Miss
<span class="smcap">Mary Anderson</span>, Miss <span class="smcap">Dorothy Dene</span>, and some other charming ladies. One
more visit to the Royal Academy, and then the Show for 1887 will have
passed away. Then, after a brief holiday, the Artists will be again at
work, according to their individual taste and fancy, taking (lucky
<i>gourmets</i>!) each one just what best suits his palette. <i>Au revoir!</i></p>

<h2>ROBERT AT THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I've</span> paid my second wisit to this most emusing place, and have to report
a grate improvement in its inside, witch is gradawally a filling up like
an hungry Alderman at a nice rich fust class dinner.</p>

<p>But this time I paid speshal attention to the outside emusements, and
them as carnt find no fun and xcitement in them, had better go off at
wunce to the Amerrycan Bar for a "Coaxer," and that, as I found, will
soon pick him up. I never saw such a site as <span class="smcap">Bufferlow Bill's</span> Wild West
in South Kensington, the werry recklekshun of it sets me off so that I
must pull myself together with one of <span class="smcap">Bertram's</span> "Brighton Steadiers," or
I shall get too exsited to write strait.</p>

<p>Well, I spose it was because they was jest a little late that the whole
blooming lot of 'em, Amerrycans and Cow Boys, and Mexicans and Injians
with their Squalls and Porposes, and Gals a riding like gals generally
rides, and Gals a riding like men, all cum a galloping in at such a
whirling pace that it litorally took away all my pore breth, and they
screamed as they galloped, and their crimson and blue and scarlet and
yeller clokes all shone in the sunlight and fluttered in the breeze, and
when they came jest in front of me, where I was setting with dignerty in
a reserwed seat at the small charge of 1s., they pulled up bang, as if
they was all shot, and all sat as still as mice.</p>

<p>Well, then we had a hole carrywan of settlers for life attacked as they
was agoing quietly along by a hole army of wild Injians, and defended by
<span class="smcap">Bufferlow Bill</span> and his bold Cow Boys, and a grand fight it was. Plenty
of firing, but not enuff execushun for to friten the ladies, for the
jest a few was killed in the dedly combat, they all got up and rode away
after the battle was over; so I spose as they was ony shamming jest to
deceeve the enemy.</p>

<p>Curiosity, which is the Waiter's weekness, makes me inquire, why so many
Cow Boys when there aint not no Cows? We wound up with a Bufferlow hunt,
but as the animals was jest as uncurry-combed and as dirty as afore, I
gammoned Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, who was with me, that it was ardly a site for a
reel dellycat lady to witness, so we went off to see the Toboggening,
and grate fun it was to look at. But, to my extreme estonishment nothink
wood do but Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robert</span> must try it, and, in spite of all my
remonstrances, I presently found myself a seated with my bitter arf on
the top of an high hill, about to be launched hedlong on our wild career
with ony a piece of rope to guide us and nothink to stop us. Oh, that
dedly moment of hezitashun! and then the rush through the hair with
sitch litening speed as made Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robert</span> give jest a little squeal. How
any sane person having wunce tried this new game, which recalled to fond
memory the sensashun of my fust swing, can wish to repeat the dose, I
carnt understand. He suttenly ought to have the stummuck of a
Horsestrich rather than of a Halderman. The fond partner of my fate
having a little hedake after her rash xperryment, which she insisted
upon declaring was owing to the rifle-shooting, I adwised her to leave
the noisy scene and seek the cumfort of her quiet home, promising to
jine her hurly, so she went. I was afterwards asked to try the
Switch-back Railway, but learning from a prewious wictim as how the
sensation reminded him of the fust time as he crossed the Channel, I
declined with thanks.</p>

<p>Hoping to meet with the Kernel who had promised to introduce me to the
Hon. Mr. <span class="smcap">William Bufferlow</span>, Esquire, wulgerly called <span class="smcap">Bufferlow Bill</span>, I
sauntered round to the Injians encampment, but was there told he had
gone to dine with some other Savages at the Savage Club, so I coudn't
see him. Howsumever I fell into conwersation with one of the tip-top
managers, and he introduced me to sum of the principal Braves, as they
calls 'em, and their Squaws, and porposes. They was worry affable and
perlite, as I'm told as all reel savages is, but I carnt say much for
their hartistick taste. There was one savage lady with a savage dorter
and a pickaninny about rising four, as grately surprised me. The yung
lady wood have bin werry good looking if her Ma had let her alone, but
she had painted her two cheeks such a brite skarlet that skarlet runners
is nothing to 'em, and as for the pore little chap his hole face was
painted a greenish yeller, like a werry bad case of jarndice, and all
his air a brite green. But such is my natral perliteness, that when his
fond Ma held him up to me and said, "Lookee, lookee, ain't him Booty?" I
said, "Oh! yessee, yessee!" I didn't dare to kiss it, for fear its face
wood have stuck to mine, witch woudn't ha bin nice.</p>

<h4>A Little Indian Rubber.</h4>
</div>

<p>I spent a werry plessent evening with the principle performers such as
<span class="smcap">Red Shirt</span>, and <span class="smcap">Cut Meat</span>, and sum others, and whenever the conwersashun
flagged I surgested a adjurnment to the Amerrycan Bar, and we allus
tried a new drink, and this I will say for my forren frends that they
took them all with the same coolness as if they had been the native
drinks of the Far West End. The larst one we tried was called "A Yard of
flannel," and for warmth and cumfort it was well-named, but somehows I
fancy it must ha bin rayther a staggerer, for I remember werry little of
what took place afterwards. But I have sum dim recklekshun of playing at
cards with two Chiefs and a Squaw, and that one of them had a dress on
sumthink like a porky-pine with his squills, and that I lost my money,
and that sum familyer voice said, "Why, <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, you've lost your Injian
Rubber!" at witch we all larfed. How I got home I don't werry well
remember, but I do remember, and shall probberbly never forget, the
werry warm recepshun I met when at length I arrived there, or the nex
morning's hed hake. I don't think I shall try "a yard of flannel," again
in an hurry.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h3>THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

<div class='figcenter'>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 27.</i>&mdash;Back again <br />to the Coercion Bill.
Report Stage reached, and strong<br /> whips out on both sides in anticipation
of Division. Both<br /> Front Benches crowded like the rest. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> in his<br />
place, as eager to make speech as if it were his first on<br /> the subject.
<span class="smcap">Hartington</span> there too, and <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>,<br /> making, with <span class="smcap">Heneage</span>, a brave
show on end of Front<br /> Bench. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> spoke early. A full House, but<br />
everyone bored to death. Later, House thinned to degree<br /> that invited a
count; but at sound of bell Members held<br /> in hand for Division, swooped
down, got themselves counted,<br /> saved the sitting, and straightway fled
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Campbell</span> concerned in interests of Protestant<br /> Church. A Papal
Envoy been received by <span class="smcap">Queen</span> to<br /> present Jubilee congratulations. Was
that an exceptional<br /> privilege for an Ecclesiastic? Would the Brahmin
Head of <br />Benares be allowed to approach <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span> in similar<br /> way? No
answer. Would the Grand Imaum of Mecca?</p>

<p>The Under-Secretary of State shivered in his shoes, but<br /> still no
response.</p>

<p>Then Sir <span class="smcap">George</span>, uplifting his voice to its most melodious<br /> heights,
produced his poser:&mdash;"Would the Moderator of the<br /> Free Church of Scotland
enjoy such a privilege?"</p>
</div>
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
</td></tr>

</div>

<p>Old Morality and his colleagues on the Treasury Bench began to grow
uneasy. No saying where <span class="smcap">Campbell's</span> list might end. <span class="smcap">Fergusson</span> whispered
to and nudged till, propped on his feet, he feebly urged that Moderator
of Free Church of Scotland does not come under the category of a Foreign
Potentate. A poor quibble this. But <span class="smcap">Campbell</span> generously disinclined to
push his advantage, and Government escaped immediate defeat.</p>

<p>Growing excitement as Division on <span class="smcap">John Morley's</span> Amendment restricting
duration of Act to three years approached. <span class="smcap">Ritchie</span> has invented new way
of taking Division. Members as anxious to try it as nursery of children
to handle new toy. At first some little difficulty in understanding it.
Members crowded round <span class="smcap">Ritchie</span> and asked how it was done.</p>

<p>"Nothing easier or clearer," he said. "There are six doors, which we
will call A, B, C, D, E, and F. As soon as division bell rings, F is
closed. B is left half open. Members voting 'Aye' pass through the A
door and meet the 'Noes' coming through D. A and C are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> then
simultaneously shut. If B is open, the 'Ayes' and the 'Noes,' having
seen E closed, form in one stream, pass through, and there you are.
Don't you see?"</p>

<h4>Young 'Olden.</h4>
</div>

<p>Everybody saw quite clearly. Quite a pleasure to see <span class="smcap">Isaac Holden</span>
(<i>etat.</i> eighty, but full of youthful vigour) starting off to try the
new experiment. Got through all right. But, half an hour later, <span class="smcap">Gilbert
Greenall</span> found in recesses of ventilating cellars, where, he said, he
was "looking for door E."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Report on Coercion Bill.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wilfrid Lawson</span> made admirable suggestion to-night. Proposes
that, when titles or honours are conferred upon anyone, a statement
should accompany announcement, setting forth the public services on
account of which the honour has been conferred. It is so done in respect
of Victoria Cross. List of Honours conferred in connection with Jubilee
show the necessity of extending custom.</p>

<p>"Who's he?" said Sir <span class="smcap">Borthwick</span>, Bart., looking down the <i>Gazette</i> when
it came out. "Never heard of him, nor him either. I seem to be really
the only distinguished person in the lot."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 25%">
<a href="images/012b.png">
<img src="images/012b.png" width="100%" alt="&quot;Who&#39;s he?&quot;" /></a>
<h4>"Who's he?"</h4>
</div>

<p>List notable not only for what it includes but for what it omits. House
of Commons united in expectation of one recognition, looked for in vain.
If "Barnets" were to be made in Jubilee time, why was <span class="smcap">Joseph Gillis</span>
overlooked? This thought in everyone's mind, as <span class="smcap">Joey B.</span> turned up
to-night telling in a division against the Government. His public
appearance now so rare that its recurrence was an event. Since he came
into possession of Castle Butlerstown the alteration, long-working, made
sudden and complete advance. His moustache, now past the indefinite
stage, is an unquestionable reality, and to see <span class="smcap">Joey B.</span> twirling it <i>&agrave;
la</i> <span class="smcap">Randolph</span>, is a delight to the quiet mind. <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> feels his new
responsibilities. When reproached by <span class="smcap">Tim Healy</span> with his excessive
respectability he is not moved.</p>

<p>"It's all very well for you, <span class="smcap">Tim</span>, to be brow-beating the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>,
interrupting Hon. Members opposite, moving the adjournment and the like.
But it's different for a man who has a Castle, a drawbridge, a moat, and
a moustache."</p>

<p>Characteristic infelicity on the part of the Government to have
neglected this opportunity of recognising a reformed character. <span class="smcap">Joey B.</span>
is now a credit to the House. It would have been to the credit of the
Government had his friends been able to hail him as Sir <span class="smcap">Joseph Gillis
Biggar</span>, Bart., of Butlerstown Castle.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Coercion Bill again.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;"He! he!" said Old Morality, his white teeth shedding pale
light over Treasury Bench. "Capital joke! Hope they'll often repeat it."</p>

<p>Capital it was, and so unexpected, too. Secret admirably kept, and
sprung upon amazed House with marvellous effect. After questions, O. M.
moved Resolutions providing for discussion on Report Stage of Coercion
Bill being peremptorily closed at Seven o'Clock on Monday night.</p>

<p>"The Early Closing Association," said Sir <span class="smcap">Wilfrid Lawson</span>, looking across
at Noble Lords and Right Hon. Gentlemen arrayed on Treasury Bench in
support of this Motion.</p>

<p>Parnellites of course hostile to Motion. But more particularly enraged
because O. M. in moving it had not spoken single sentence.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said <span class="smcap">John Dillon</span>, "this is too bad. If we are to lose our
liberties, let us, at least, have a speech in support of the
proposition."</p>

<p>But O. M. obdurately silent, and debate kept up for three hours from
Opposition side. Then Division taken, and Motion carried by majority of
a round hundred. After this, Ministers looked forward to another
wearisome evening, with Friday to follow, and more talk through Monday
up to fatal Seven o'Clock. Here's where the joke came in. The
Opposition, returning from Division Lobby after voting on Closure
Proposition, continued their march through the House and cleared out by
the door. Ministers watched process with amazement, growing into
apprehension, and finally broadening into a grin of delight as the joke
flashed upon them. Having given Government the trouble of preparing,
moving and carrying Resolution, fixing closure of debate on Monday
evening, Irish Members not going to debate at all! The Government might
take their Report Stage; which they did, and before you could say "<span class="smcap">W. H.
Smith</span>," the Report Stage of the Coercion Bill was agreed to, and House,
scarcely recovered from surprise, was engaged upon miscellaneous
business of the Orders of the day.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Midnight.</i>&mdash;Since dinner-time there has been exhilarating scene
in Palace Yard. Nearly every 'bus that has passed has dropped a Duchess
at the gate. Four-wheelers, conveying Countesses, have regularly filed
in; whilst, what Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Peel</span> would call "Noble Baronesses," have
arrived on foot. As distinguished Novelist somewhere writes, "Lo! a
strange thing has happened." On ordinary days House of Lords, which
commences public business at 5&middot;30, adjourns about 5&middot;37. At this hour of
midnight House still sitting, and no sign of Adjournment. Irish Land
Bill under debate. Subject irresistible to Noble Lords. Have foregone
their late afternoon drive in the Park. More than one has patriotically
dined on a chop.</p>

<p>A flush of honest pride mantles many a noble countenance. All very well
for the Commons to boast of their long sittings; but see what the Peers
can do when duty calls! At first a little consternation at the arrivals
from without. But even that turns out well. There were stories of
anxious wives communicating with House of Commons during All-night
Sittings, and finding errant husbands not there. But here are Noble
Lords unflinchingly serving their country, remaining at their post,
whate'er betide.</p>

<p>A beautiful and a soothing sight, which affects to tears some of the
Commons, who sit in the Gallery, and look down upon it.</p>
